# Content-Based Routing in Apache Camel (VIZED)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement **Content-Based Routing**, one of the **Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)**, using **VIZED** and **Apache Camel**. The routing mechanism inspects the content of incoming messages and dynamically directs them to appropriate destinations based on predefined criteria.

<!-- This route will be developed using **Vized**, a no-code platform that simplifies the creation of Apache Camel routes. -->

## Features

- **Content-Based Routing**: Messages containing the keyword `Error` are redirected to the `ErrorQueue`, while all others go to the `NormalQueue`.
- **Logging**: Logs messages at different stages of processing.
- **File-based Trigger**: The route initiates processing using a `file` component.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to install three important piece of software:

### Install Java (OpenJDK)

1. Visit the [Java SE Development Kit (JDK) download page](https://adoptium.net/)
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version (e.g., Java 17 or Java 21) for your operating system.
3. Run the installer, accepting the default settings
4. Verify Java Installation
    - Open a command prompt (cmd) / terminal.
    - Type this command:
      ```bash
      java --version
      ```

### Install JBang

<!-- JBang is a tool that lets you run Java applications easily from the command line. It's especially useful for running Apache Camel via the Camel CLI. -->

1. Visit the [official JBang download page](https://jbang.dev/download)
2. Choose the installation method based on your operating system below.
      #### For Windows
      1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.
      2. Run the following command:
          ```powershell
          iex "& { $(iwr https://get.jbang.dev) }" 
          ```
      #### For Mac Users (using Homebrew):
      1. Open **Terminal**.
      2. Run the following command:
          ```bash
          brew install jbangdev/tap/jbang
          ```
      #### For Linux Users:
      1. Open **Terminal**.
      2. Run the following command:
          ```bash
          curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup
          ```
3. Verify JBang Installation
    ```bash
    jbang version
    ```

### Install Apache Camel
1. Install Apache Camel using JBang (recommended)
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
    jbang app install camel@apache
    ```
3. Verify Apache Camel Installation
    ```bash
    camel --version
    ```

## Creating the Route Using Vized
1. Navigate to the Workspace and create a new Integration Project.

2. Click on the "Add Route" button within the visual designer. Search for the File Component and add it from the Component tab.

4. Add the Choice processor and configure multiple routing conditions. For each condition, add a Direct component to define different message destinations.

    ![Vized - Create Project](/EIP/ContentBasedRouter/assets/ChoiceComponent.gif)

6. Create three new routes:

    - ErrorQueue
    - SuccessQueue
    - OtherQueue

    ![Vized - Create Project](/EIP/ContentBasedRouter/assets/AddDirectComponent.gif)

7. Add Log Processor to the each of the destination routes to record message details.

## Running the Project With Monitoring in Vized

Monitor your integration visually using Vized‚Äôs built-in Topology View for real-time execution tracking.

- Select your integration project in Vized, Right-click on Camel file, open context menu, and select "Run".

    ![alt text](/EIP/ContentBasedRouter/assets/run.png)

- Once running, Click View Monitoring. Each component (node) in the topology view will show real-time **execution counts** next to it.

## üêû Running the Project in Debug Mode

Debug your routes step-by-step using Vized‚Äôs integrated debugging tools.

- Right-click the Camel file in your project and choose **Debug** from the context menu.

    ![alt text](/EIP/ContentBasedRouter/assets/debug.png)

- The terminal will open, Switch to the **Debug** tab to step through the route, inspect values, and troubleshoot logic in real time.

## üöÄ Running the Project with Monitoring in Vized

Leverage Vized's built-in **Topology View** to monitor your Apache Camel routes in real time.

### Steps to Execute with Monitoring:

1. **Run the Integration Project**
   - In Vized, right-click on the Camel file of your integration project.
   - Select **Run** from the context menu.
   
   ![Run Project](/EIP/ContentBasedRouter/assets/run.png)

2. **Open Monitoring View**
   - Once execution begins, click on **View Monitoring**.
   - The Topology View will display live **execution counts** next to each route component, helping you trace message flow visually.

<!-- ## Customization

- Modify the `setBody` expression to change message content dynamically.
- Add more conditions under `choice` for additional routing logic.
- Integrate with external queues like **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, or **ActiveMQ**. -->
