# Content-Based Routing in Apache Camel (VIZED)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement **Content-Based Routing**, one of the **Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)**, using **VIZED** and **Apache Camel**. The routing mechanism inspects the content of incoming messages and dynamically directs them to appropriate destinations based on predefined criteria.

<!-- This route will be developed using **Vized**, a no-code platform that simplifies the creation of Apache Camel routes. -->

## Features

- **Content-Based Routing**: Messages containing the keyword `Error` are redirected to the `ErrorQueue`, while all others go to the `NormalQueue`.
- **Logging**: Logs messages at different stages of processing.
- **File-based Trigger**: The route initiates processing using a `file` component.

## Prerequisites


## Creating the Route Using Vized
1. Navigate to the Workspace and create a new Integration Project.

2. Click on the "Add Route" button within the visual designer. Search for the File Component and add it from the Component tab.

4. Add the Choice processor and configure multiple routing conditions. For each condition, add a Direct component to define different message destinations.

6. Create three new routes:

    - ErrorQueue
    - SuccessQueue
    - OtherQueue

7. Add Log Processor to the each of the destination routes to record message details.

## Running the Project With Monitoring in Vized

Monitor your integration visually using Vized‚Äôs built-in Topology View for real-time execution tracking.

- Select your integration project in Vized, Right-click on Camel file, open context menu, and select "Run".

- Once running, Click View Monitoring. Each component (node) in the topology view will show real-time **execution counts** next to it.

## üêû Running the Project in Debug Mode

Debug your routes step-by-step using Vized‚Äôs integrated debugging tools.

- Right-click the Camel file in your project and choose **Debug** from the context menu.

## üöÄ Running the Project with Monitoring in Vized

Leverage Vized's built-in **Topology View** to monitor your Apache Camel routes in real time.

### Steps to Execute with Monitoring:

1. **Run the Integration Project**
   - In Vized, right-click on the Camel file of your integration project.
   - Select **Run** from the context menu.
   
   ![Run Project](assets/run.png)

2. **Open Monitoring View**
   - Once execution begins, click on **View Monitoring**.
   - The Topology View will display live **execution counts** next to each route component, helping you trace message flow visually.

<!-- ## Customization

- Modify the `setBody` expression to change message content dynamically.
- Add more conditions under `choice` for additional routing logic.
- Integrate with external queues like **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, or **ActiveMQ**. -->
