Vized: AI-Assisted No-Code Integration Platform
Vized is a powerful AI-assisted no-code platform tailored for developers and integration specialists to visually design, build, and manage complex integration workflows.
Built on Apache Camel, Vized fully supports Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs), enabling robust, scalable, and flexible system integrations with minimal manual coding.


Key Features:
Visual Integration Builder: Design integration routes and business processes using a drag-and-drop interface.
Visual Data Mapper: Easily transform data between different systems or formats.
AI Assistance: Generate routes, components, and transformations using context-aware AI suggestions.
OpenAPI Generation: Automatically generate and update OpenAPI documentation for your integration workflows.
YAML DSL Powered: Uses Apache Camelâ€™s YAML DSL to define all routes and integration logic behind the scenes.

Technical Architecture and Guidelines:

Primary DSL: YAML (Apache Camel YAML DSL)
Supported Languages for Scripting: Groovy (preferred), JavaScript.
Java language or .java files are not supported.
Beans must be defined inline within YAML. External bean files are strictly discouraged.
Preference is given to AI based examples.

Rules for writing yml dsl code.
------------------------------------------
- Every route/component must include a unique id.
- Use uri and component parameters wherever applicable.
- Expression aware steps with Explicit Expression field is implemented.
- Prioritize reusable Apache Camel components over custom code.
- For bean type must be specified.

Validation:
YAML routes are validated against the official Camel YAML DSL schema:

This repo contains the examples for vized. Which is posted weekly.

Prompts for creating example.
------------------------------
Write a simple example using apache camel yaml dsl. 
Runtime is jbang, route will be executed like camel run *.
